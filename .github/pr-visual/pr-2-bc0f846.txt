This PR represents a major evolution of **`pr-visual`**, moving from a simple diff-to-image generator to an **"Agentic" codebase explorer**. It also introduces full project documentation and a more robust GitHub Action.

Here is the creative brief for the infographic:

### Creative Brief: "The Brain Upgrade" (Agentic PR Visualization)

**The Core Story:**
The PR transforms the tool from a "blind" diff reader into an "intelligent explorer." Previously, the AI only saw the changed lines; now, it can browse the entire repository (using `readFile` and `listFiles`) to understand the *intent* and *context* behind a change before designing the visual.

**Key Insight:**
Deep context leads to better visuals. By "chaining" Gemini CLI's exploration with `pr-visual`'s rendering, we bridge the gap between "what changed" and "why it matters."

**Visual Components:**
1.  **The "Before vs. After" Flow:**
    *   **Old Way:** `Git Diff` ➔ `Static Analysis` ➔ `Generic Image`.
    *   **New Agentic Way:** `Git Diff` ➔ `Codebase Exploration (The "Brain")` ➔ `Creative Brief` ➔ `Context-Aware Infographic`.
2.  **The Toolset:** Small icons representing the new internal tools: `readFile` (a magnifying glass over code) and `listFiles` (a folder tree).
3.  **The Styles:** A small "palette" or carousel showing the 5 supported aesthetics: *Clean, Excalidraw, Minimal, Tech, and Playful.*
4.  **GitHub Action Integration:** A snippet-like visual showing how the new `prompt` input allows users to pass external AI "briefs" into the action.

**Style Recommendation:**
*   **Style:** `Tech` (Dark mode with neon accents). This highlights the "AI/Agentic" nature of the update.
*   **Palette:** GitHub Dark background (#0d1117), Cyan for logic flow, and Magenta for the final visual output.

**Headline Options:**
*   "Beyond the Diff: Agentic PR Visuals"
*   "Visualizing with Context"
*   "The Brains Behind the Beauty"

**Data Points to Include:**
*   New `prompt` input for custom control.
*   Full `README.md` documentation added.
*   Agentic workflow template provided.
*   Infinite-loop protection (paths-ignore) implemented.
