### Creative Brief: The Agentic Upgrade (Context-Aware PR Visuals)

**The Core Story:**
This PR evolves `pr-visual` from a standard diff-to-image tool into an "Agentic" visualization system. By integrating with Gemini CLI, the tool can now explore the entire codebase to understand the *why* and *how* of a change before generating a visual. This bridges the gap between raw code changes and high-level architectural understanding.

**Key Insight:**
The introduction of the `prompt` input enables **Intelligence Chaining**. Instead of analyzing a static diff, `pr-visual` can now receive a "Creative Brief" generated by an AI agent that has explored the full project context.

**Visual Components:**

1.  **The "Intelligence Loop" Diagram:**
    *   **Phase 1 (Exploration):** A "Brain" icon (Gemini CLI) using a magnifying glass over a folder tree representing the codebase.
    *   **Phase 2 (The Brief):** The Brain outputs a "Creative Brief" document icon.
    *   **Phase 3 (Rendering):** This brief feeds into the `pr-visual` engine.
    *   **Phase 4 (Output):** A high-fidelity, context-aware infographic.

2.  **The "Before vs. After" Flow:**
    *   **Old Way:** `Git Diff` ──→ `Basic Visual` (Limited Context).
    *   **New Way:** `Git Diff` + `Codebase Exploration` ──→ `Creative Brief` ──→ `Rich Infographic` (Full Context).

3.  **Feature Callouts (Icons):**
    *   **`prompt:` Input:** A code snippet icon showing the new entry point for custom briefs.
    *   **Infinite Loop Shield:** A shield icon labeled `paths-ignore`, representing the safeguard against recursive Action triggers.
    *   **Style Palette:** A small grid of 5 swatches representing the supported aesthetics: *Clean, Excalidraw, Minimal, Tech, and Playful.*

4.  **Documentation Foundation:**
    *   A background element of a structured document representing the newly added comprehensive `README.md` and workflow templates.

**Headline Options:**
*   Visualizing with Context: The Agentic Upgrade
*   Beyond the Diff: Brains Meet Beauty
*   Codebase Exploration Meets Infographic Design

**Style Recommendation:**
*   **Style:** `CLEAN / CORPORATE`
*   **Palette:** Professional blues and grays with a teal accent for the new "Agentic" path.
*   **Layout:** A structured grid with clear visual hierarchy, using polished boxes with subtle shadows.

**Data Points to Include:**
*   New `prompt` input for agentic chaining.
*   Automated `@google/gemini-cli` integration.
*   5 distinct visual styles supported.
*   Infinite-loop protection for CI/CD.

IMPORTANT STYLE OVERRIDE: Use a CLEAN / CORPORATE style: Professional PowerPoint aesthetic, polished boxes with shadows, blues/grays/teal palette, clean sans-serif fonts, structured grid layout.
