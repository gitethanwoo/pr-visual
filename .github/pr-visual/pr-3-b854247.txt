I will start by exploring the codebase to understand how the agentic logic is integrated and confirm the current state of the project.
I will now check `action.yml` to see the current inputs and how the action is intended to be used.
I will now examine `action/run.js` to see how the Gemini CLI is being used for PR analysis.
I will read `src/analyze.ts` to see if there is any additional information that could be relevant for the creative brief.
**Creative Brief: "Beyond the Diff — The Agentic Evolution of PR Visual"**

**Goal:** Visualize the transition of the `pr-visual` action from a basic diff-to-image tool to an "Agentic Analyst" that understands the entire codebase context.

**Key Insight:** Context is the bridge between code and clarity. By using Gemini CLI to read the repository alongside the diff, `pr-visual` now generates insights based on "why" and "how," not just "what changed."

**Visual Concept: "The Context Engine"**
A central, glowing Gemini "Brain" icon acting as a processor.
1.  **Intelligent Input:** On the left, a raw Git Diff document merges with a translucent 3D "Codebase Tree" (representing the tool's new ability to read files). Both flow into the central Brain.
2.  **Agentic Analysis:** Inside the Brain, show "gears" or "scanning beams" labeled "Agentic Context" and "Deep Understanding."
3.  **Versioned Output:** On the right, instead of a single image, show a **stacked deck of three infographic cards**. 
    *   The top card is vibrant and labeled "Latest (Commit `7f8e9a`)".
    *   The cards below are slightly faded and labeled with older SHAs (e.g., `4a2b3c`), representing the new commit-based history.
4.  **UI Integration:** A small, clean callout box showing a "Previous versions" dropdown menu, mirroring the new GitHub comment UI.

**Style & Palette:**
*   **Style:** TECH / DARK MODE.
*   **Background:** Deep obsidian (#0d1117).
*   **Accents:** Electric Cyan (#00d4ff) for active analysis, Neon Magenta (#ff00ff) for the versioned history, and Monospace typefaces for technical labels.
*   **Atmosphere:** High-tech, precise, and automated.

**One Key Diagram:**
A horizontal flow: **[Diff + Repository] ➔ [Gemini Agent] ➔ [Versioned Infographic History]**.

**Headline:** "Context-Aware PR Visuals: Every Commit, Fully Understood."

IMPORTANT STYLE OVERRIDE: Use a CLEAN / CORPORATE style: Professional PowerPoint aesthetic, polished boxes with shadows, blues/grays/teal palette, clean sans-serif fonts, structured grid layout.
