### Creative Brief: The Agentic Upgrade

**The Core Story:**
This PR upgrades `pr-visual` from a simple diff-to-image tool into a powerful, two-path system. It introduces an "Agentic" workflow, allowing an external AI agent (like Gemini CLI) to first explore the entire codebase, understand the PR's context, and then feed a detailed "creative brief" into `pr-visual` to generate a much smarter, context-aware infographic.

**Key Insight:**
The core change is the new `prompt` input in the GitHub Action. This decouples the "analysis" from the "visualization," enabling a more intelligent, context-rich image generation process. The tool is no longer just reading a diff; it's now capable of interpreting a high-level creative brief.

**Visual Components:**
1.  **The Forking Path Diagram:**
    *   Start with a central "Git Diff" icon.
    *   **Path 1 (The Old Way):** An arrow labeled "Simple" points directly to the `pr-visual` logo, resulting in a "Basic Visual."
    *   **Path 2 (The New "Agentic" Way):** An arrow labeled "Agentic" points to a "brain" icon representing Gemini CLI exploring the codebase. This then outputs a "Creative Brief" (represented by a document icon) which feeds into the `pr-visual` logo, resulting in a much more detailed "Context-Aware Visual."
2.  **Feature Callouts (as small icons/text):**
    *   **`prompt:` input:** Show a small code snippet from the `action.yml` highlighting the new `prompt` option.
    *   **New `README.md`:** An icon of a comprehensive document or book to represent the new, full documentation.
    *   **Loop Prevention:** A shield icon next to the workflow file, labeled "`paths-ignore`", showing the safeguard against infinite loops.

**Style Recommendation:**
*   **Style:** `Tech` (Dark mode with neon accents) to emphasize the AI/Agentic nature of the update.
*   **Palette:** A dark background (#0d1117), with cyan for the "Agentic" flow and a contrasting color like magenta for the final output visual.

**Headline Options:**
*   Beyond the Diff: The Agentic Workflow
*   Two Paths to Visualization
*   A Brain for Your PR Visuals

**Data Points to Include:**
*   New `prompt` input enables advanced "Agentic" workflows.
*   Full `README.md` documentation added.
*   New `pr-visual-with-gemini-cli.yml` template provided.
*   Infinite-loop protection implemented in workflows.

IMPORTANT STYLE OVERRIDE: Use a CLEAN / CORPORATE style: Professional PowerPoint aesthetic, polished boxes with shadows, blues/grays/teal palette, clean sans-serif fonts, structured grid layout.
